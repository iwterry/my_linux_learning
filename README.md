This repository is being used to store my notes for courses and explorations I am doing with Linux in order to help me better understand Linux. It is intended as something I can use to go back to later. 

At cbt_nuggets__comptia_linux_plux/ are my notes for the [CBT Nuggets course for Linux+ XK0-005](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/comptia/linux-plus)

At udemy__linux_command_line_and_shell_scripting_masterclass/ are my notes and scripts for the [Linux Command-Line & Shell Scripting for Absolute Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-command-line-and-shell-scripting-masterclass/)
